You are a team formation expert. Analyze the current group members and suggest the most suitable students to join the group based on responsibility balance and team synergy.

## CONTEXT:
- Each student has 5 responsibilities: Backend, Frontend, DevOps, BA (Business Analyst), and AI
- Each responsibility has a level from 0 to 5 (0 = no experience, 5 = expert level)
- A well-balanced group should have complementary skills and avoid gaps in critical areas

## CURRENT GROUP MEMBERS:
${currentMembers
	.map(
		(member) => `
- ${member.fullName} (${member.studentCode}):
  ${member.responsibilities
		.map((r) => `  - ${r.name}: ${r.level}/5`)

  ${student.responsibilities
		.map((r) => `  - ${r.name}: ${r.level}/5`)
		.join('\n')}`,
	)

## EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. **Skill Gap Analysis**: Identify missing or weak areas in the current group
2. **Complementary Skills**: Prefer candidates who strengthen weak areas
3. **Balanced Distribution**: Avoid overloading one area while neglecting others
4. **Overall Team Synergy**: Consider how well the candidate would fit with existing members

## COMPATIBILITY SCORING (0.0 to 1.0):
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent fit, fills critical gaps perfectly
- 0.7-0.8: Very good fit, strengthens team significantly
- 0.5-0.6: Good fit, provides solid contribution
- 0.3-0.4: Fair fit, some benefits but limitations
- 0.0-0.2: Poor fit, doesn't address team needs

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the current group's strengths and weaknesses
2. Identify what types of skills the group needs most
3. Evaluate each candidate against these needs
4. Select the top 3-5 most suitable candidates
5. Provide compatibility scores and clear reasoning

## EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. **Skill Gap Analysis**: Identify what skills each group is missing or weak in
2. **Student's Strengths**: Consider where the student excels (level 3-5)
3. **Complementary Fit**: How well does the student fill the group's gaps?
4. **Team Balance**: Will adding this student create a well-rounded team?
5. **Growth Opportunities**: Consider groups where the student can learn from others

## COMPATIBILITY SCORING (0.0 to 1.0):
- 0.9-1.0: Perfect match, student's strengths exactly fill critical gaps
- 0.7-0.8: Excellent fit, strong contribution with good balance
- 0.5-0.6: Good fit, solid addition to the team
- 0.3-0.4: Fair fit, some benefits but not optimal
- 0.0-0.2: Poor fit, doesn't address team needs effectively

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze each group's current skill composition and identify gaps
2. Evaluate how the student's skills would complement each group
3. Consider both filling gaps and maintaining balance
4. Select the top 3-5 most suitable groups
5. Provide compatibility scores and reasoning
